# Sigchain: an economic engine

## What is Sigchain?

Sigchain is a cryptocurrency system built on a distributed serverless network. Rather than the issuer of new credit being a bank, or some version of a centralised authority, Sigchain instead enables producers themselves to issue credit.

There have been thousands of currencies in history which have collapsed and disappeared over time. These unstable currencies have failed to sustain durable markets, and the instability of these currencies lie in their design

## Banks, fiat currency and conventional cryptocurrencies

More than a hundred years ago, the modern central banking system assumed the authority to issue credit and run our ledgers, however, with government, corporate and personal debt at record unsustainable levels, it is clear something is not working.

When cryptocurrencies appeared more than a decade ago, many people who believed we needed a new financial system were understandably very excited. With novel use of cryptography, digital currencies like Bitcoin proved they could both issue new credit and operate a ledger – the key components of any money system - without a central bank.

However, it has become abundantly clear that cryptocurrencies in their current form are not going to lead to a sustainable new economy. So far no cryptocurrency has proven to be stable and trustworthy enough to be broadly adopted. Instead of fiddling at the edges with variations of the Bitcoin template, we need to reconsider the design of money itself at a more fundamental level. This is what Sigchain is all about.

## What makes Sigchain different?

Sigchain is different from other cryptocurrencies in that each participant has their own blockchain, their own ledger, which only they can sign transactions to, equivalent to writing a personal cheque. By replacing traditional blockchain architecture with a signature chain, or ‘sigchain’, we place credit issuance in the hands of market participants themselves. Sigchain is the first digital currency to work this way.

This sigchain structure allows for a producer credit system, a credit engine for entrepreneurial communities. Sigchain solves the challenge of credit-worthiness and issuance using historical transactions and the reliability of transacting parties. We see this creditworthiness as a measure of market based ‘reputation’.
Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have proven to be volatile in the face of speculative investment. They have also turned out to be environmentally unsustainable because of the wasteful process of ‘mining’ (i.e. issuing) coins by using electricity-hungry server farms to solve arbitrary mathematical problems. Meanwhile, modern banking backs today’s conventional bank credit with oil and mortgage debt.

In the Sigchain system, producers issue credit as a promise to the market, a claim on future production – analogous to bond issuance. This credit, or promise, is redeemed when products are consumed by consumers. This fulfils the fundamental function of debit and credit as a cycle through the marketplace.

With quantitative easing, the pretence of ‘trickle-down’ economics, and repeated bailouts of banks deemed ‘too big to fail’, modern financial institutions have proven to be unreliable in the way they issue new credit into the economy. And while Google attempts checking accounts and Facebook prepares to launch its cryptocurrency, Libra, both will repeat the traditional model of issuing currency from a centralised platform, and, like banks, will suffer from the same problems that come as a result.

To solve this problem we believe humanity needs a back-up system, a plan B, using a new class of financial systems.

## Who is behind Sigchain?

Graham Munro and Jules McLachlan have been researching cryptocurrencies and monetary systems for more than five years. Since 2018, they have been developing and refining the conceptual basis of Sigchain, and in early 2019 they started designing the Sigchain transactional messaging schema. Over the past six months they have convened a small group of developers, designers and engineers, as they take steps towards creating the production ready Sigchain software platform.

They have developed a relatively simple “reference implementation” of the Sigchain platform. This prototype allows users to trade between each other, and can issue, transfer and redeem units. The underlying platform is a distributed decentralised network protocol. 

## What’s next for Sigchain?

The immediate goal is to complete the Sigchain platform. This will make it possible to test the stability and robustness of Sigchain at scale and over a long time frame. We’ll explore the feasibility of new business opportunities such as a currency exchange etc.

Our goal is to channel investor funds in two principal directions: firstly, to a team of developers working on the Sigchain platform, interface and modelling environment, and secondly, towards leaders in the open-source development communities that do much of the heavy lifting around ensuring the stability and robustness of the underlying decentralised network that Sigchain is based on. 

We are looking for strategic partners for growth and funding. We have a team of ten world class people standing by. Early investors will become our capital partners in new applications and services built on the platform.
