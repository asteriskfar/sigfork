# Beyond the blockchain

An economy is a large-scale and sophisticated mechanistic device to utilise the specialisation of labour and to realise the profit of that labour. It enables many people to play an individual role in total production. It is the way all of mankind is able to collaborate together to meet our collective needs.

Each person’s money-related behaviour affects the whole system, turning tiny gears of a massive machine and although one person’s use may have a relatively negligible effect on the whole system, our total aggregate use, that of billions of individuals, has a very real, very noticeable effect on the entire economic system and therefore on society, community and culture.

We claim that our lives are directly influenced by the systems we use to group and that our most fundamental systems are money, governance, and reputation. The design of these systems will determine our sustainable success and well-being. The earth and environment are also direct beneficiaries of these systems.
We propose a high-level network architecture for an economic system that integrates money, governance and reputation. With this system we introduce a method for issuing, and redeeming a digital coin using a mechanism that solves large-scale economic challenges and aims to create a sustainable global economy and a free market.

## An economic operating system

Sigchain is a new global economic model, that operates as a single global transaction database. It is the world’s first money, governance and reputation engine deployed as a large-scale platform. With its own money tool, it aims to solve the fundamental problems of the current financial mechanism and the inherent limitations of blockchain based financial technology. Sigchain provides the foundation for the world’s first economic operating system and autonomic AI.

The Autonomic system operates as a free market prices computer, calculating costs, prices and value pathways using global transaction data. It’s an economic operating system in which humanity can collaborate effectively, and capitalise productive industry. The challenge of generating wealth for humanity, without externalising costs, is the greatest challenge of our day. It is critical to creating a sustainable society and environment.
