# What do we really mean by 'Financial Technology'

The goal of any financial system is to support and grow industry, provide purchasing power for labor, create high quality production and wealth. This is the centre of human safety and environmental regeneration.
There will be thousands of fintech startups and blockchain projects that will come and go over the next few years, but only the sustainable will survive. And sustainability is about design. We believe that an emergent digital market system requires a completely new design, integrated as one scaleable platform on the Internet. While new players emerge in the financial technology industry, we are yet to see what we consider to be a real game changer.

If we are to optimise humanityâ€™s incredible innovative ability we must create an economic system to generate wealth and meet our productive ability. Sigchain is a world-scale, open source software project that comprises a new kind of money. This world-scale free market prices computer forms the foundation of an intelligent economy.
